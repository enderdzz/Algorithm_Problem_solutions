# algorithm_problem_solutions

Problems derive from some competitive algorithm contests and other places.

+ Codeforces (still alive)
+ Bestcoder/BZOJ/POJ (old school)
+ other online juage platforms
+ met in some CTFs (maybe PPC/MISC/RE type)
+ Project Euler
+ met in the life

But now, here is becoming a playground for me to learn different languages by solving algorithm problems!
Especially Go & Rust & Haskell <3
